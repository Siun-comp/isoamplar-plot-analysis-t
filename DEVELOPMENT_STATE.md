## Purpose
Single project state snapshot for resuming work after context compression.

## Status
Active

## Last Updated

## Compression-Safe Summary
- IsoAmplar Plot Analysis MVP implementation has progressed through Phase 8 plus the 2026-07-08 UI/analysis refinement passes.
- Stack: React + Vite + TypeScript, SheetJS/xlsx, Apache ECharts, Zustand + Immer, `@tanstack/react-virtual`, Vitest + Testing Library, Playwright.
- MVP input: `.xls` / `.xlsx` upload only, first worksheet only. CSV, paste/manual entry, app-side data editing, and sheet picker are deferred.
- Parser preserves raw fluorescence values; no smoothing, normalization, baseline correction, log transform, averaging, or Ct/Cq calculation is applied.
- Default selection view is reagent-first. Import starts with all major groups collapsed. Selection identity is `curveId`; single-file parser IDs use `sheet0_col_<ExcelColumnLetter>`, and appended file IDs use an import prefix such as `file2_sheet0_col_A`.
- Search/display-filter bulk actions apply across the full dataset, including collapsed groups.
- Chart preview uses ECharts with white background, sparse major grid, no minor grid, animation off, `connectNulls: false`, and a fixed preview viewport height that does not stretch with side-panel expansion. On desktop the chart panel is sticky while the page scrolls.
- X/Y Auto, Fixed, and user-editable P1/P2 scale presets are implemented. P1/P2 have no invented default min/max values and become selectable only after valid numeric bounds are entered.
- Style controls include specimen/reagent group color with picker and HEX input, line type, stable default colors based on original data/group order, individual curve overrides, marker options, built-in presets, one-step preset undo, and user legend/export order.
- Export supports PNG/JPEG downloads, PNG clipboard copy with fallback message, and plotted-data CSV only for current rectangular common-X chart projections.
- GitHub Pages asset base is configured as `./` by default. Actual GitHub deployment has not been performed.

## Current Goal
MVP implementation and the requested IsoAmplar refinement passes are complete locally. Next work should focus on manual validation with the real workbook, clipboard verification, and GitHub Pages deployment.

## Current Milestone
M8 - MVP release preparation complete locally, with post-MVP UI refinement applied.

## Last Completed Step
Completed the 2026-07-08 refinements: app rename to IsoAmplar Plot Analysis, developer credit, fixed/sticky plot viewport, stable default color assignment, editable P1/P2 scale presets, Fixed auto-bound display/copy, marker override options, append Excel upload, grouping-aware curve labels, tree row banding, and compact settings/export sizing.

## Implemented
- Documentation baseline: `AGENTS.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and docs `01` through `08`.
- React/Vite SPA scaffold with relative asset base for static hosting.
- Excel parser:
  - `.xlsx` and `.xls`
  - first worksheet only
  - row 1 specimen, row 2 reagent, row 3+ fluorescence
  - generated `Cycle 1..N`
  - ignored later sheet warning
  - invalid first sheet failure
  - missing header warnings
  - merged header warning, no auto-fill
  - empty/nonnumeric/formula-without-cache warnings
  - cached numeric formula values accepted, formulas never recalculated
  - appended workbook import into the current analysis via a separate add action
- Normalized data model:
  - typed `PcrDataset`, `Curve`, `PcrWarning`, source metadata, curve stats
  - stable source-position `curveId`
  - similar-name warnings without merge/rename
- Selection UI:
  - upload-first top panel
  - replace upload and append upload controls
  - reagent-first/specimen-first views
  - panel mode label follows the current view
  - all major groups collapsed after import
  - search and all/selected/unselected/warning display filter
  - bulk select/unselect for displayed result set across collapsed groups
  - tri-state group checkboxes
  - grouped tree row banding for first- and second-level classification rows
  - virtualized major-group rendering in browser
- Chart and settings:
  - central chart option builder for preview/export parity
  - ECharts canvas chart
  - fixed preview chart viewport height independent from left/right panel expansion
  - sticky center chart panel on desktop while side panels/page scroll
  - Auto/Fixed X/Y scale with validation and current auto-bound display
  - user-editable P1/P2 scale presets per analysis session, selectable only after valid min/max values
  - >20 visible-curve warning
  - stable default colors based on original specimen/reagent order rather than visible selection index
  - group style rules and individual curve overrides
  - color picker plus HEX color input for group and individual curve styles
  - default solid lines with no markers; optional individual markers: circle, triangle, rect
  - built-in presets with overwrite semantics and one-step undo
  - user legend/export order
  - curve labels in selection, chart, legend order, and CSV follow the active grouping mode
- Export:
  - PNG/JPEG image download with white background and `YYMMDD_plotN.ext`
  - PNG clipboard copy with fallback message
  - plotted-data CSV with `YYMMDD_plotN_data.csv` when common-X rectangular output is safe
  - failed export attempts do not consume `plotN`
- Browser-local processing only; no backend or remote upload.

## Key Decisions
- `D013`: accepted stack.
- `D014`: narrowed PCR MVP scope.
- `D015`: clean modern PCR chart style; reference image is direction only.
- `D016`: fixture/snapshot baseline.
- `D017`: official SheetJS CDN tarball and npm in this exFAT workspace.
- `D018`: curve IDs use `sheet0_col_<ExcelColumnLetter>`.
- `D019`: missing headers import with warnings and source-position fallback identity.
- `D020`: bulk selection uses current search/filter result set across full dataset.
- `D021`: P1/P2 scale values are not invented.
- `D022`: preview/export/CSV order share the central projection; SheetJS and ECharts/export are lazy-loaded.
- `D023`: product identity is IsoAmplar Plot Analysis with developer credit Jang Si Un.
- `D024`: 2026-07-08 chart refinement rules for fixed viewport height, stable colors, editable P1/P2 presets, and no default markers.
- `D025`: append upload identity, sticky chart, grouping-aware labels, tree banding, and compact settings/export sizing.

## Verification Status
- `npm run test`: passed, 37 Vitest tests.
- `npm run build`: passed.
- `npm run test:e2e`: passed, 2 Chromium Playwright tests.
- `npm audit --omit=dev`: 0 vulnerabilities.
- Playwright checks include upload-first smoke, generated `.xlsx` upload, append `.xlsx` import, reagent-first collapsed state, search bulk select, chart canvas visibility, nonwhite pixel count, chart viewport height stability after settings expansion, and sticky chart panel behavior.

## Known Gaps
- Actual GitHub Pages deployment has not been performed.
- Clipboard image copy has not been manually verified in Chrome/Edge on the final deployment origin.
- Static fixture files and expected normalized JSON snapshots are still not checked in; tests currently generate workbook fixtures.
- Real `C:\Users\siunj\Desktop\graph_TEST.xlsx` has been inspected read-only but has not yet been uploaded through the finished UI in this session.
- Performance budgets for max file size, row count, specimen count, imported curve count, and rendered curve count remain undecided.
- P1/P2 scale presets are user-editable per analysis session but are not persisted after app reload/import reset.
- Git repository is not initialized.

## Next 3 Tasks
1. Manually upload `C:\Users\siunj\Desktop\graph_TEST.xlsx` in the UI, append another workbook if available, and compare labels, curve count, warnings, chart, scale presets, marker options, and export output.
2. Verify clipboard PNG copy in Chrome/Edge under local preview and later GitHub Pages.
3. Decide whether P1/P2 presets, style presets, and chart configuration should be saved/reloaded across sessions.
