## Compression-Safe Summary
- MVP testing is PCR-specific, not generic spreadsheet charting.
- MVP input is Excel upload only: `.xls` and `.xlsx`, first worksheet only.
- CSV import, pasted input, manual entry, and in-app data editing are deferred beyond MVP.
- Testing must cover PCR/LAMP-style import, append import, stable curve IDs, reagent-first selection, collapsed groups, search, grouping-aware labels, fixed axes, user-editable P1/P2 presets, clean chart visual style, stable colors, default no markers, style/legend behavior, PNG/JPEG export, clipboard fallback, and GitHub Pages.
- Exported images must match the current rendered chart state, use a white background, and use analysis-name-based safe filenames.
- Plotted-data CSV export is allowed only for a simple current chart projection.
- Analysis XLSX export/import must preserve the full imported dataset and settings, including unselected curves.
- Internal analysis tabs must preserve independent per-tab analysis state.
- Custom legend and export layout behavior must be tested separately from curve selection state.
- Fixture manifest and expected snapshot schema live in `docs/07_FIXTURE_SNAPSHOT_PLAN_KR.md`.
- Known gaps must be recorded instead of assumed away.

## Update Rule
Update this file whenever requirements change, bugs are fixed, release criteria change, or new risk areas are discovered.

## Test Scope

## Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criterion | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AC-001 | FR-001 | User can import a valid `.xls` or `.xlsx` file and see a normalized PCR model parsed from the first worksheet only. | Automated + manual |
| AC-002 | FR-001, FR-004 | User can review detected specimen labels, reagent labels, fluorescence columns, generated cycles, and import warnings. | Automated + manual |
| AC-003 | FR-003 | Pasted input, manual entry, and in-app data editing are not required in MVP; correction flow is source-file edit followed by reupload. | Manual/document review |
| AC-004 | FR-005 | Selection, grouping, search, and search bulk actions update the selected curve set and rendered chart data. | Automated + manual |
| AC-005 | FR-007 | Multi-chart layout and batch arrangement are deferred; the single-chart MVP layout remains usable without overlap or clipped controls. | Manual + visual |
| AC-006 | FR-006, FR-008 | Chart, style, and legend settings affect the rendered chart as configured. | Automated + manual |
| AC-007 | FR-009 | Fixed X scale is applied consistently across redraws and relevant filter, selection, grouping, and style changes until changed by the user. | Automated + manual |
| AC-008 | FR-010 | Fixed Y scale is applied consistently across redraws and relevant filter, selection, grouping, and style changes until changed by the user. | Automated + manual |
| AC-009 | FR-011 | Image download produces a valid PNG or JPEG of the current chart output, without surrounding UI controls, with white background and an analysis-name-based safe filename such as `YYMMDD_<sanitizedAnalysisName>_plotN.ext`. | Automated smoke + manual |
| AC-010 | FR-012 | Clipboard copy places the selected image layout on the clipboard where supported; the dedicated legend clipboard action copies a legend-only PNG without changing the selected export layout; otherwise the UI shows a clear download fallback. | Component + manual + fallback test |
| AC-011 | FR-013 | The app works from a GitHub Pages style URL without backend services. | Build + manual |
| AC-012 | FR-014 | Invalid file type, invalid first sheet, invalid axis bounds, export failure, and clipboard failure show actionable errors. | Automated + manual |

## PCR-Specific Acceptance Criteria

These criteria bind implementation to decisions `D010` through `D016`.

| ID | Requirement / Decision | Acceptance Criterion | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AC-PCR-001 | FR-001, IO-001, D012, D014 | Excel upload creates a normalized PCR model with stable curve IDs, specimen labels from row 1, reagent labels from row 2, fluorescence values from row 3 onward, and generated cycle values when no X axis is present. | Automated + manual |
| AC-PCR-002 | D003 | Importing, selecting, rendering, and exporting PCR data remains browser-local and does not send uploaded data to a backend. | Automated network guard + manual |
| AC-PCR-003 | D011, D012 | The default selection tree is reagent-first. | Component + E2E |
| AC-PCR-004 | D011 | Reagent-first and specimen-first views are projections over the same curve IDs and preserve identical selection state when toggled. | Unit + component |
| AC-PCR-005 | D012 | Search matches the full normalized dataset, and search bulk actions apply to every matching curve including collapsed, nonvisible, and virtualized rows. | Unit + component + E2E |

| AC-PCR-010 | FR-011, D014 | PNG and JPEG export produce valid images matching current preview selection, scale, style, legend/order state, and export layout, using a white background and analysis-name-based safe filenames. | Automated smoke + manual |
| AC-PCR-011 | FR-012, D007 | Clipboard export succeeds where supported and shows image-download fallback when unsupported, blocked, or denied. | Manual + fallback test |
| AC-PCR-012 | D012, D014 | More than 20 visible curves triggers a readability warning and assistance path, but preview/export remain enabled and include all visible curves. | Component + E2E |
| AC-PCR-013 | D011 | Large datasets with dozens to hundreds of specimens and up to 8 reagents remain usable within the agreed performance budget. | Performance smoke + manual |
| AC-PCR-014 | D010 | Retired/default-forbidden UI terms do not appear in user-visible UI unless later approved: `replicate`, `series`, `solo/isolate`, hover/solo emphasis wording, and exclude/restore wording. | Automated text scan + manual |
| AC-PCR-015 | FR-001, IO-001, D014 | Multi-sheet workbook import always uses worksheet index 0; later sheets are ignored. If the first sheet is invalid, import fails even if later sheets are valid. | Parser unit + E2E |
| AC-PCR-016 | FR-001, IO-001, D014 | `.xls` and `.xlsx` fixtures with equivalent first-sheet data normalize to equivalent PCR curve data. | Parser unit |
| AC-PCR-017 | FR-003, IO-004, D014 | Imported specimen, reagent, and fluorescence values cannot be edited in the app; correcting source data requires reupload. | Component + manual |
| AC-PCR-018 | FR-005, D014 | All reagent/specimen major groups are collapsed immediately after import, with counts and checkbox state still accurate. | Component + E2E |
| AC-PCR-019 | FR-004, D014 | Similar names trigger a warning listing affected labels but do not change IDs, labels, selection, grouping, or export names. | Parser unit + component |
| AC-PCR-020 | FR-008, D014 | Built-in presets apply to the chosen scope, overwrite affected individual style fields deterministically, report affected count, and provide one-step undo. No saved custom presets are required in MVP. | Unit + component |
| AC-PCR-021 | FR-016, D014 | Plotted-data CSV export, when available, contains only currently plotted curves in current legend/export order. It excludes hidden/unselected curves and raw workbook-only data. | Unit + E2E |
| AC-PCR-022 | FR-016, D014 | Plotted-data CSV export is disabled with a clear reason unless the current chart is simple: one chart, shared X values across visible curves, and rectangular CSV output possible. | Unit + component |
| AC-PCR-023 | FR-006, FR-011, D015, D032 | The default chart theme is clean and analysis-readable: white background, sparse major grid lines only, no dense minor grid by default, readable title/axis/legend spacing including large Y-axis tick labels, balanced line widths, distinguishable but controlled colors, and PNG/JPEG export matches the preview style. Reference images are not hardcoded: example-specific title, axis labels, axis ranges, threshold/reference line, marker shapes, colors, legend labels, curve count, and data values must not be fixed from the reference. | Playwright screenshot + visual/manual + export smoke |
| AC-PCR-024 | FR-006, FR-008, FR-009, FR-010, D021, D023, D024 | The app identity is `IsoAmplar Plot Analysis` with developer credit `Jang Si Un`; preview plot height remains stable when side settings expand; default curve colors remain stable as earlier/later curves are selected; default lines have no markers; individual curve marker overrides support none, circle, triangle, and rect; P1/P2 X/Y presets are user-editable and selectable only with valid min/max; Fixed mode displays current Auto bounds for editing support. | Unit + component + E2E |
| AC-PCR-025 | FR-001, FR-005, FR-006, FR-008, D025 | The app can append another `.xls`/`.xlsx` first worksheet to the current analysis without replacing existing data; appended curves receive unique IDs, are added unselected at the end of user order, and preserve existing selected curves, scale, style, overrides, and chart output. Reagent mode uses reagent-first labels across selection, legend, legend order, and plotted CSV; specimen mode uses specimen-first labels. The center chart panel stays visible on desktop scroll, tree group/subgroup rows are visually distinguishable, compact scale/export controls do not clip labels, and group/individual style colors can be entered by HEX code as well as picker. | Unit + component + E2E + visual/manual |
| AC-PCR-026 | FR-005 | A subgroup containing a single curve is displayed as one selectable row without duplicate checkboxes. | Unit + component + E2E |
| AC-PCR-027 | FR-008, D029 | Color, line, and marker bases and individual override origins are clearly shown in the UI as baseline, Custom, or Preset. | Unit + component + manual |
| AC-PCR-028 | FR-008, D029, D032 | Specimen and reagent group styles can set line type and marker none/circle/triangle/rect through a compact combined line/marker selector, and the result is reflected in chart and legend rendering. | Unit + component + visual |
| AC-PCR-029 | FR-008, D029 | Field-level, curve-level, selected-curves, and all-overrides reset actions restore baseline style behavior without changing unrelated data. | Unit + component |
| AC-PCR-030 | FR-008, FR-019, D028 | Custom legend does not obscure the plot, represents actual resolved line type and marker type including no-marker curves, and hover/focus on a legend item transiently highlights the matching curve. | Component + Playwright visual |
| AC-PCR-031 | FR-011, FR-012, FR-019, D028, D032 | Preview legend visibility, export legend inclusion, Plot only / Plot + Legend / Legend only image export layouts, standard selected-layout clipboard PNG, and dedicated legend-only clipboard PNG work independently and produce visually valid image outputs. | Unit + component + E2E + export pixel smoke + Playwright visual |
| AC-PCR-032 | FR-008, FR-019, D029 | Legend order changes preserve style overrides on the same curve IDs, move by the currently selected curve order even when unselected curves sit between them, and preview/export/data/style-row order remain consistent. | Unit + component + E2E |
| AC-PCR-033 | FR-017, D026 | Analysis XLSX export stores the complete imported dataset, source metadata, warnings, selection, order, scale, style, legend/export settings, analysis name, and export counter, regardless of whether curves are currently selected or plotted. Analysis XLSX filenames are safe and sanitized, and transient UI state, runtime tab IDs, and dirty state are excluded. | Unit + workbook readback |
| AC-PCR-034 | FR-017, D026 | Analysis XLSX import restores the hidden JSON state, including unselected curves, while assigning a tab-local analysis ID and clean dirty state; missing, corrupt, chunk-damaged, or unsupported restore sheets show clear errors. | Unit + component + E2E |
| AC-PCR-035 | FR-018, D027 | Multiple analysis tabs keep dataset, selection, search, display filter, collapse state, scale, style, legend/export order, export counter, source files, and analysis name independent. Tab overflow remains usable without breaking the main layout. | Unit + component + E2E + visual |
| AC-PCR-036 | FR-001, FR-017, FR-018, D027 | File actions distinguish original Excel and Analysis XLSX: replace, append, restore, and new-tab open do not conflict. Dirty unsafe close, replace, or restore actions are blocked until a close/replace UX is finalized. | Unit + component + E2E |
| AC-PCR-037 | FR-006, FR-017, D026 | Analysis XLSX contains no native editable Excel chart, and export/import performs no smoothing, normalization, baseline correction, Ct/Cq, threshold, or positive/negative interpretation. | Unit + package/workbook inspection |
| AC-PCR-038 | FR-020 | With X values around 1-100, 100 visible curves x 100 points passes browser smoke testing, and hundreds to 1000 imported curves remain selectable through virtualization/search. | Performance smoke + manual |
| AC-PCR-039 | FR-020 | Hover information is available through a fixed readout or equivalent UI that does not block plot inspection; chart and legend hover highlight clears on pointer exit and does not alter marker/style/export state. | Component + Playwright |
| AC-PCR-040 | FR-020, D032 | Large style and legend lists remain operable through search, scrolling, virtualization, and compact group controls that avoid unnecessary horizontal scrolling. | Component + Playwright |
| AC-PCR-041 | FR-008, FR-011, FR-017, FR-019, D028 | Selected, chart-visible, legend-visible, export-layout, and Analysis XLSX persisted settings are separate states; changing one does not implicitly mutate the others. | Unit + component + E2E + Analysis XLSX roundtrip/readback |
| AC-PCR-042 | FR-008, D029 | Individual style rows show curve identity, clear column labels, source disambiguation for duplicate labels, and reset/status controls that target the intended curve ID. | Component + E2E |
| AC-PCR-043 | FR-020 | Main tab, tree, accordion, style, legend, and export controls are keyboard reachable and expose accessible names/states where feasible. | Component + Playwright accessibility smoke + manual |

## PCR Test Phases

1. Requirements and fixture definition: create small, medium, large, malformed, `.xls`, `.xlsx`, appended-workbook, multi-sheet, similar-name, over-20-curve, and data-export fixtures with expected normalized JSON snapshots.
2. Browser-local Excel parsing: test specimen/reagent extraction, first-sheet-only behavior, `.xls`/`.xlsx` equivalence, generated cycles, nonnumeric values, blank rows/columns, duplicate or similar names, missing headers, uneven lengths, formulas, old `.xls` encodings, protected files, and unsupported files.
3. Normalized PCR model: test stable curve IDs, source sheet/range, warnings, style state, selection state, and legend/export order.
4. Selection tree and search: test reagent-first default, specimen-first toggle, grouping-aware labels, all-groups-collapsed default, tri-state checkboxes, collapse/expand, full-dataset search matching, and search bulk actions.
5. Chart rendering: test selected-curve rendering, no implicit PCR transformations, null/missing values, clean visual theme, and over-20 readability warning without blocking preview/export.
6. Scale preset and fixed axis: test Auto, Fixed, P1, P2, min/max validation, current Auto bound display, and persistence across redraw triggers.
7. Style preset and override: test style precedence, stable default colors, default no markers, individual marker overrides, built-in preset overwrite, affected-count feedback, and one-step undo.
8. Analysis state and tabs: test serializable AnalysisState, multi-tab independence, dirty unsafe-action blocking, and analysis name/source name separation.
9. Analysis XLSX: test full-dataset export, hidden restore JSON, visible review sheets, roundtrip restore, invalid schema/chunk errors, and no native editable chart.
10. Legend and export order: test manual order, custom legend, selected order, reagent/specimen order, preview/export parity, and state separation.
11. PNG, JPEG, clipboard, plotted-data CSV, and export layout: test valid chart-only/plot+legend/legend-only images, white background, fake-date filename generation, selected-layout clipboard success/fallback, dedicated legend-only clipboard success/fallback, simple plotted-data CSV, and disabled non-simple data export.
12. Performance, accessibility, and release: test large datasets, virtualized tree/style/legend behavior, hover readout, keyboard navigation, browser compatibility, and GitHub Pages base path.

## Manual Test Cases
Before a user-visible MVP release:

1. Import a valid `.xlsx` PCR workbook.
2. Import an equivalent valid `.xls` PCR workbook.
3. Import a multi-sheet workbook and confirm only the first worksheet is used.
4. Import a workbook whose first worksheet is invalid and a later worksheet is valid; confirm import fails.
5. Import a workbook whose active tab is not the first sheet; confirm worksheet index 0 is still used.
6. Confirm all major groups are collapsed after import and no curves are selected by default.
7. Toggle between reagent-first and specimen-first views and confirm selection is preserved.
8. Search across all data and apply a bulk selection action to matches inside collapsed groups.
9. Select a small readable set of curves and render the PCR line chart.
10. Select more than 20 visible curves and confirm the warning appears while export remains possible.
11. Set fixed X and Y axis bounds, then change selection and confirm scale remains fixed.
12. Apply a built-in style preset, confirm affected-count feedback, and use one-step undo.
13. Change legend order and confirm preview/export order matches it.
14. Download PNG and JPEG and confirm valid output, white background, and `YYMMDD_<analysisName>_plotN.ext` filenames with sanitized analysis names.
15. Copy the selected chart image layout to clipboard where supported; copy the legend-only PNG through the dedicated action; confirm fallback where unsupported or blocked.
16. Export plotted-data CSV for a simple current chart; confirm only plotted curves in current order are included.
17. Confirm plotted-data CSV is disabled with a clear reason for a non-simple chart state.
18. Test the production build through the same base path used by GitHub Pages.
19. Review the default chart screenshot and confirm it has a clean modern PCR-plot feel without dense background grid lines.
20. Confirm the implementation does not hardcode reference-image content such as title, threshold line, axis ranges, colors, marker shapes, legend labels, or data values.
21. Create two analysis tabs, import different workbooks, and confirm selection, scale, style, legend order, and export counter do not leak between tabs.
22. Rename an analysis tab and confirm source file labels and chart labels are not unintentionally changed.
23. Export Analysis XLSX, reload it, and confirm all imported curves, including unselected curves, warnings, scale, style, order, and export settings are restored.
24. Attempt an unsafe dirty-tab replace/restore and confirm the app blocks data loss or requires explicit confirmation according to the finalized policy.
25. Toggle preview legend visibility and export layout modes and confirm the plot remains unobscured.
26. Confirm custom legend samples match solid/dashed/dotted lines and none/circle/triangle/rect marker settings.
27. Hover chart curves and custom legend items, then move the pointer away; confirm highlight clears and configured markers do not disappear or change.
28. With large Y-axis values around 1,200,000, confirm the `Fluorescence` axis label does not overlap tick labels.
29. In group style rows, confirm the color popover opens with HEX entry first and the combined line/marker popover shows all line and marker choices without horizontal scrolling.

## Browser Matrix
Minimum manual verification candidates:

- Latest Chrome
- Latest Edge
- Latest Firefox

Clipboard image behavior should be explicitly checked in Chrome and Edge because browser support and permissions differ.

## GitHub Pages Checks
- Production build emits static assets only.
- No backend server is required.
- No secrets or server-only environment variables are required.
- Asset paths work under a repository base path.
- File import uses browser APIs only.
- Clipboard image copy is tested in HTTPS deployment or a realistic local equivalent.

## Sample Test Data
Create or collect fixture datasets for:

- `.xlsx` PCR workbook: 1 specimen x 8 reagents.
- `.xls` PCR workbook equivalent to the `.xlsx` baseline.
- Real old BIFF `.xls` workbook with Korean labels.
- PCR workbook: many specimens sharing the same reagent names.
- PCR workbook: more than 20 selectable/visible curves.
- PCR workbook: similar specimen or reagent names such as `Sample1`, `Sample 1`, and `Sample-1`.
- PCR workbook: nonnumeric fluorescence cells.
- PCR workbook: formulas with and without cached values.
- PCR workbook: missing specimen or reagent cells.
- PCR workbook: empty rows, empty columns, and uneven curve lengths.
- Multi-sheet workbook where worksheet 0 is valid and later sheets differ.
- Multi-sheet workbook where worksheet 0 is invalid and a later sheet is valid.
- Multi-sheet workbook where worksheet 0 is valid, later sheet is invalid, and import still succeeds from worksheet 0.
- Workbook whose active tab is not worksheet index 0.
- Unsupported/corrupt/password-protected workbook.
- Formula workbook with cached numeric values.
- Formula workbook without cached values.
- Large workbook for performance smoke testing.
- Simple plotted-data export case with shared cycle X values.
- Non-simple plotted-data export case with mismatched X arrays or non-rectangular output.

## Automation Candidates
- Excel parser tests for `.xls` and `.xlsx`.
- First-sheet-only parser tests.
- Expected normalized JSON snapshot tests.
- Fixture manifest path/existence tests once fixtures are created.
- Similar-name warning tests.
- Header and missing-value validation tests.
- Search and selection-state tests.
- Tree derivation and collapsed-default tests.
- All-collapsed initial state snapshot tests for reagent-first and specimen-first trees.
- Axis validation tests.
- Style precedence, preset overwrite, and one-step undo tests.
- Preset undo state-machine tests covering second preset replacement and undo unavailable after use.
- Legend/export order tests.
- Export filename tests with fake browser-local date and sanitized analysis names, for example `260709_Run_A_plot1.png`, `260709_Run_A_plot2.jpg`, and legacy/no-name helper coverage such as `260707_plot1.png`.
- Export filename counter edge tests: image+CSV share a number, CSV-only consumes next number, failed export does not consume a number.
- Export image smoke tests for PNG/JPEG validity and white background.
- Playwright screenshot comparison/review for default chart visual theme.
- Clipboard fallback UI tests.
- Plotted-data CSV inclusion and disabled-reason tests.
- Plotted-data CSV shape tests: header row, duplicate header disambiguation, blank cell for null Y, quoting/escaping, row order.
- End to end smoke test for import to chart to PNG/JPEG download.
- AnalysisState serialization and deserialization tests.
- Multi-tab independence tests for dataset, search/filter/collapse, selection, scale, style, order, and export counter.
- Analysis XLSX workbook readback tests for visible sheets and hidden restore JSON.
- Analysis XLSX filename sanitization, export counter continuation, and failed-export counter tests.
- Analysis XLSX invalid schema, missing hidden sheet, chunk corruption, and ordinary workbook fallback tests.
- Custom legend rendering tests for line and marker samples.
- Export layout tests for Plot only, Plot + Legend, and Legend only.
- State separation tests for selected/chart-visible/legend-visible/export-layout/restore settings.
- Style editor identity tests for duplicate labels and curveId-safe resets.
- Hover/readout, custom-legend hover/focus highlight, marker-preservation during hover, and >20 curve assistance tests.
- Large style/legend list virtualization or search tests.
- Keyboard/accessibility smoke tests for analysis tabs, tree, settings accordions, style rows, legend controls, and export controls.

## Accessibility Checks
- File input and primary controls are keyboard reachable.
- Buttons have accessible names.
- Grouping toggle has radio or equivalent semantics.
- Accordion/tree controls expose expanded/collapsed state.
- Mixed checkboxes expose their mixed state.
- Form errors are associated with relevant controls where feasible.
- Color is not the only signal for warnings or selected curves.
- Focus remains usable after file import and chart updates.

## Known Gaps
- PCR parser, selection UI, chart preview, style controls, legend order, image export utilities, clipboard fallback, and plotted-data CSV utilities are implemented for MVP.
- The selected test stack is installed and configured for unit/component/Playwright smoke tests.
- Static checked-in sample fixture files do not exist yet; generated workbook fixtures are used in Vitest and Playwright tests.
- PCR-specific expected normalized JSON snapshots do not exist yet.
- Browser checks have been performed with Playwright: upload-first smoke, generated `.xlsx` upload, appended `.xlsx` upload, collapsed reagent-first selection, internal analysis tab switching, fixed hover readout smoke, chart canvas nonblank pixel check, fixed chart viewport height after settings expansion, sticky chart panel behavior, and public URL technical smoke with generated `.xlsx` upload.
- Clipboard behavior has not been manually verified in Chrome/Edge under the final deployment origin.
- GitHub Pages deployment behavior was verified on 2026-07-08 through the Pages workflow and public URL technical smoke with generated `.xlsx` data.
- GitHub Actions Pages deploy currently runs `npm run test` and `npm run build`; `npm run test:e2e` and `npm audit --omit=dev` are local release checks unless the workflow is expanded later.
- Performance budgets for file size, specimen count, imported curve count, and rendered curve count have not been finalized.
- P1/P2 presets are editable per analysis session and can be preserved through explicit Analysis XLSX export/import, but automatic browser-session persistence is not provided.
- Analysis XLSX export/import is implemented for full-dataset restore files; native editable Excel charts and report-style chart-image XLSX output remain deferred.
- Internal analysis tabs are implemented; tab-count warning/hard-cap behavior remains undecided.
- Hover readout, app-controlled curve highlight, custom-legend hover/focus highlight, marker-preserving hover behavior, and >20 visible-curve assistance are implemented; large style/legend lists use search/scroll affordances.
- Dirty tab close/replace UX and internal tab count policy remain product decisions.
