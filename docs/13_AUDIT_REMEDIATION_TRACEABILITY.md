# Audit Remediation Traceability and Evidence

## Status

- Phase: S3 legend identity and raster fidelity complete; final independent expert verdict GO
- Updated: 2026-07-11
- Product acceptance state: Target / Known red unless explicitly marked passing baseline
- Data policy: synthetic-only fixtures and generated values

## Status Vocabulary

- `Baseline passing`: existing behavior is protected by an active test.
- `Partial known red`: isolated defect-signature probe reproduces a specified subset of the audit defect; this is not acceptance.
- `Target TODO`: acceptance wording is frozen but no executable probe is safe or complete yet.
- `Partial foundation`: S1 infrastructure exists but later release gates remain open.
- `Decision pending`: implementation depends on a listed UD item.

## Fixed Evidence Files

- Manifest: `tests/fixtures/manifest.json`
- Generator: `tests/fixtures/generateFixtures.mjs`
- Expected projections: `tests/fixtures/expected/`
- Binary sources: `tests/fixtures/source/`
- Passing fixture tests: `tests/data/parseExcel.fixture.test.ts`
- Isolated known-red probes: `tests/audit/knownRed.audit.ts`
- Remaining target TODO inventory: `tests/audit/auditEvidence.todo.test.ts`
- Raster evidence helper: `tests/e2e/helpers/rasterEvidence.ts`

## S1 Exit Rule

S1 completes when fixed hashes, passing baseline tests, isolated known-red probes, Target/TODO inventory, early CI artifact plumbing, and this matrix agree. No row becomes product-accepted solely because S1 evidence exists.

## S1 Local Verification Evidence

- Fixture regeneration: 14 generated source/snapshot files checked; 0 changed; `manifest.json` remained byte-identical.
- Regular regression: `npm run test` passed 22 files / 172 tests with 7 explicit Target TODOs.
- Known-red evidence: `npm run test:audit:red` passed 5 exact defect-signature probes. A passing probe means the documented defect was reproduced, not remediated.
- Production build: `npm run build` passed. One preceding Node 24.14.1 Windows run generated all assets and then hit a non-reproducing `libuv` shutdown assertion; the immediate rerun exited 0.
- Fresh browser: CI-mode Chromium ran 5 Playwright tests from a newly started port 4173 preview server.
- Same artifact: all 25 files in the browser-tested `dist` matched `evidence/dist-files.sha256`; the CI gate regenerates the complete sorted manifest after Playwright and compares it byte-for-byte, so added, deleted, or changed files fail the job. A local negative-control check added a temporary 26th file, confirmed the comparison failed, removed it, and reconfirmed the final 25-file equality. Local tree digest: `2b32208e7d09730fcd7a09fc9c05b80e8c10d12577c52abb673f47599f9dfdb5`.
- Dependency audit: `npm audit --omit=dev` reported 0 vulnerabilities.
- Desktop visual evidence: `docs/gui_mockups/screenshots/s1_fixture_import.png` uses only generated FX-002 synthetic labels and values; 1920x1080 render had no console/page errors or horizontal overflow.
- CI scope: `.github/workflows/s1-ci.yml` is read-only and non-deploying. An actual GitHub Actions run is intentionally pending user approval to commit/push the branch.
- Product behavior: no `src/` file changed in S1. The known-red product defects remain scheduled for later phases.

## S2 Local Verification Evidence

- Scale invariant: Fixed/P1/P2 draft state is separate from last valid applied mode/bounds; invalid active drafts keep preview bounds and block only plot-bearing image output.
- Export parity: component tests verify PNG, JPEG, and chart clipboard receive identical applied X/Y bounds; Legend-only, report legends, plotted CSV, and Analysis XLSX remain available.
- Persistence: Analysis XLSX schema 2 stores and requires draft/applied scales; schema 2 missing-applied corruption rejection, full schema 1 workbook migration, and invalid-draft roundtrip are covered.
- Numeric safety: iterative finite reductions replace unbounded min/max and row-width spreads in accepted parser, stats, chart domain, merge, plotted CSV, and workbook paths.
- Boundary evidence: exact 250,000 x 1 and 500 x 500 Quick Paste cases parse; 501 x 500 rejects before import. Full 3 x 83,333 and character/UI responsiveness evidence remains S5.
- Box zoom: round-trip numeric formatting preserves small, negative, exponential, large, and adjacent distinct bounds with `min < max`; Previous scale snapshots retain draft and applied state.
- Automated regression: `npm run test` passed 24 files / 190 tests with 7 Target TODOs; `npm run test:audit:red` now contains 3 remaining exact defect signatures.
- Production/browser: `npm run build` passed; fresh CI-mode Chromium passed 15/15 tests across three repetitions, including invalid draft, applied-range retention, plot-image blocking, Analysis XLSX availability, Legend-only image allowance, and deterministic Export disclosure handling.
- Desktop visual: `docs/gui_mockups/screenshots/s2_scale_draft_applied.png` uses FX-002 synthetic data at 1920x1080 with no console/page errors or horizontal overflow.

## S3 Local Verification Evidence

- Projection: preview, standard/report raster, and rich Excel clipboard retain the same user order and resolved line/marker style by `curveId`; report projection is produced once per chart build.
- Identity layout: browser `measureText` drives bounded maximum-two-line rendering. Semantic label segments use explicit middle ellipsis that keeps the leading context plus lot/concentration/temperature-style endings.
- Auto-compact title: long shared specimen/reagent identity in a report legend title uses the same measured, bounded, end-preserving two-line rule and exposes title bounds for regression checks.
- Collision handling: unresolved full or rendered-label collisions include curveId and immutable source evidence. Legend-bearing SVG/PNG/JPEG/Excel output rejects the collision; Plot-only bypass remains unchanged.
- Bounds and style automation: SVG evidence covers no out-of-canvas text/sample bounds and all 12 solid/dashed/dotted x none/circle/triangle/rect combinations without changing requested dimensions.
- Browser raster: the generated synthetic `s3-legend-identity.xlsx` flow verifies visible Lot A/B endings, dashed/dotted run-count separation, circle/rect pixel-area separation, a 2400-pixel PNG width at 2x export ratio, white corners, and nonblank content.
- Automated regression: `npm run test` passed 26 files / 199 tests with 7 Target TODOs; `npm run test:audit:red` now contains 2 remaining non-S3 defect signatures; `npm run build` passed; fresh CI-mode Chromium passed 6/6.
- Desktop browser: the local production preview returned HTTP 200 and showed no horizontal overflow, replacement characters, console warnings, or page errors.
- Desktop visuals: `docs/gui_mockups/screenshots/s3_legend_identity_desktop.png` and `docs/gui_mockups/screenshots/s3_legend_export.png` contain only synthetic condition/assay labels.
- Manual boundary: rich Excel clipboard cell values/order/font/style payload are automated; final Chrome/Edge to Windows Excel visual fidelity remains a documented manual check.
- Fixture status: FX-006 is active/passing for S3 and FX-007 is active/passing for S2 across the generator, expected targets, manifest, and fixture plan.
