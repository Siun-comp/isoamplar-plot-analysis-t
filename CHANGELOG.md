Agent / Engineering

## Compression-Safe Summary
- The MVP is implemented locally as IsoAmplar Plot Analysis.
- The current change set includes documentation, GUI mockup planning, accepted implementation stack, narrowed PCR/LAMP plot MVP scope, and post-MVP UI/analysis refinements.
- Feature changes should be recorded under `Unreleased`.
- Release entries should follow Keep a Changelog style.
- Known limitations should remain visible.

## Update Rule
Update this file when user visible behavior, documentation baseline, release readiness, or known limitations change. Internal refactors only need entries when they matter to users or maintainers.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Created initial documentation scaffold.
- Added agent operating rules and context compression protocol.
- Added initial project charter in Korean.
- Added functional requirement IDs for import, filtering, charting, fixed axes, export, clipboard copy, and GitHub Pages deployment.
- Added initial input/output specification.
- Added initial acceptance criteria and test strategy.
- Added GUI option proposal document with four page structure candidates and expert review notes.
- Added static GUI mockup HTML and rendered screenshots for Option A, Option B, Option C, and recommended Option D.
- Consolidated the GUI mockup into one A/D-style working baseline with Option A data selection and scale controls, no visible column labels, group style rules, individual curve overrides, and large-curve usability affordances.
- Added legend order controls, legend/style preset controls, and clearer individual curve settings to the consolidated mockup.
- Added specimen-first/reagent-first selection view controls, major-group collapse/expand controls, and four right-side settings accordions to the consolidated mockup.
- Added reagent-first default selection, search-result-wide bulk actions, preset overwrite summary, export-order summary, and visible-curve readability warning to the consolidated mockup.
- Added a phased implementation plan with step-by-step implementation prompts in `docs/06_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_KR.md`.
- Added PCR-specific acceptance criteria and test phases to the test plan.
- Added accepted implementation stack decision: React + Vite + TypeScript, SheetJS/xlsx, Apache ECharts, Zustand + Immer, `@tanstack/react-virtual`, Vitest + Testing Library, and Playwright.
- Added accepted MVP input/output scope: `.xls`/`.xlsx` Excel upload only, first worksheet only, no CSV/paste/manual input, no in-app data editing, PNG/JPEG white-background export, and conditional plotted-data CSV export.
- Added `AC-PCR-015` through `AC-PCR-022` covering first-sheet-only behavior, `.xls` equivalence, disabled editing, collapsed groups, similar-name warnings, preset overwrite/undo, and plotted-data CSV rules.
- Added accepted default chart visual style decision for clean modern PCR plots: white background, sparse major grid, no dense minor grid by default, readable title/axis/legend layout, and preview/export visual parity.
- Added explicit rule that reference chart images are style direction only and must not be hardcoded as fixed chart content or settings.
- Added Pre-Phase fixture manifest and normalized snapshot schema in `docs/07_FIXTURE_SNAPSHOT_PLAN_KR.md`.
- Added accepted fixture/snapshot baseline decision `D016`.
- Added React + Vite + TypeScript Phase 0 scaffold with package scripts, Vitest config, Playwright config, and a minimal three-panel app shell.
- Added verified dependencies and lockfile, using official SheetJS CDN tarball for `xlsx@0.20.3` and ECharts `^6.1.0`.
- Added Phase 0 smoke tests: one Vitest component test and one Playwright browser test.
- Added Phase 0 scaffold screenshot at `docs/gui_mockups/screenshots/phase0_scaffold.png`.
- Added Phase 1 normalized PCR data model types for datasets, curves, source metadata, warnings, tree nodes, style overrides, and selection state.
- Added Phase 1 sample dataset utilities covering 1 specimen x 8 reagents, shared reagents across specimens, similar labels, and more than 20 imported curves.
- Added Phase 1 selection utilities for reagent-first/specimen-first tree derivation, all-collapsed initial state, curveId-only selection, group selection, collapse toggling, and all-dataset search matching.
- Added Phase 1 unit coverage for stable `sheet0_col_<ExcelColumnLetter>` curve IDs, raw-label preservation, similar-name warning-only behavior, reagent-first defaults, group collapse defaults, and grouping-mode selection persistence.
- Added accepted curve ID convention decision `D018`.
- Added Phase 2 `.xlsx` / `.xls` Excel parser using the first worksheet only.
- Added direct cell-address parsing for PCR row structure: row 1 specimen, row 2 reagent, row 3+ fluorescence, generated cycle X values.
- Added Phase 2 import warnings for ignored later worksheets, invalid first worksheet, missing headers, merged headers, empty fluorescence cells, nonnumeric fluorescence, formulas without finite cached values, unsupported file extensions, and unreadable workbooks.
- Added BIFF `.xls` parser smoke coverage with Korean labels.
- Added accepted missing-header import policy decision `D019`.
- Added Phase 3 Zustand + Immer app store for upload/import status, dataset state, search, display filter, grouping mode, collapse state, and selected curve IDs.
- Added Phase 3 upload-first UI connected to `.xls`/`.xlsx` parser.
- Added Phase 3 reagent-first/specimen-first selection panel with all-collapsed default groups, search, all/selected/unselected/warning filters, tri-state group selection, individual curve checkboxes, and all collapse/expand controls.
- Added accepted displayed-result bulk selection decision `D020`.
- Added Playwright browser upload test using a generated `.xlsx` workbook.
- Added Phase 4 ECharts PCR line chart preview with central chart option builder, white background, sparse major grid, no minor grid, fixed/auto X/Y scale controls, and >20 visible-curve warning.
- Added accepted P1/P2 scale preset decision `D021`; P1/P2 bounds are user-defined and mode buttons remain unavailable until valid values exist.
- Added Phase 5 style controls for specimen/reagent group color and line type, individual curve overrides, built-in presets, one-step preset undo, and user legend/export order.
- Added Phase 6 PNG/JPEG image export, PNG clipboard copy with fallback message, `YYMMDD_plotN` filename generation, export counter handling, and plotted-data CSV export for safe common-X chart projections.
- Added Phase 7 virtualized major-group tree rendering and deferred search query handling.
- Added Phase 8 release checklist at `docs/08_RELEASE_CHECKLIST_KR.md`.
- Added Phase 8 desktop/mobile screenshots for the implemented MVP.
- Added IsoAmplar Plot Analysis product name and developer credit for Jang Si Un.
- Added editable per-analysis P1/P2 scale preset fields for both X and Y axes.
- Added current Auto range display and a Fixed scale action to copy current Auto bounds into editable min/max fields.
- Added individual curve marker options: none, circle, triangle, and rect.
- Added regression tests for stable default colors, default no-marker chart rendering, marker symbol mapping, editable P1 scale behavior, developer credit, and fixed chart viewport height.
- Added append Excel upload so an additional `.xls`/`.xlsx` first worksheet can be added to the current analysis without replacing existing data.
- Added unique rekeying for appended curves to avoid `curveId` collisions across files.
- Added grouping-aware curve labels so reagent mode displays `reagent / specimen` and specimen mode displays `specimen / reagent` in selection, chart legend, legend order, and plotted CSV.
- Added sticky desktop chart preview behavior while long side panels/page content scrolls.
- Added first- and second-level selection tree row background banding.
- Added HEX color text input beside color pickers for group styles and individual curve styles.

### Changed
- Replaced default replicate/series/exclude/restore-style wording in the active GUI baseline with individual curve and selected/unselected terminology.
- Adjusted the consolidated mockup layout so long settings panels scroll independently instead of stretching the chart area into a large blank region.
- Changed the right settings panel default state so only Scale is expanded while Style, Legend Order, and Export remain collapsed with summaries.
- Changed the active GUI baseline to treat reagent-first navigation as the default analysis orientation.
- Updated planning status so implementation starts with a fixture/scope Pre-Phase before app scaffolding.
- Rewrote the implementation plan so Phase 0 scaffolds directly with the accepted stack instead of stopping for technology selection.
- Rewrote the test plan around the narrowed PCR MVP and removed CSV/paste/manual-entry checks from MVP release scope.
- Updated I/O rules so plotted-data CSV exports only the current simple chart projection as `YYMMDD_plotN_data.csv`.
- Updated project state after expert-agent review and final user scope decisions.
- Updated chart rendering plan and acceptance criteria to include clean visual-theme verification.
- Updated parser and export planning policies: formulas are not recalculated in-browser, missing Y renders as chart gap and CSV blank, failed exports do not consume `plotN`, and duplicate CSV headers are disambiguated.
- Updated Pre-Phase plan and test criteria to include `AC-PCR-023` and the fixture/snapshot manifest.
- Updated dependency decision after audit: npm registry `xlsx@0.18.5` was replaced with official SheetJS CE 0.20.3 tarball; ECharts was updated to 6.1.0.
- Updated implementation state after Phase 1 verification with `npm run test`, `npm run build`, and `npm run test:e2e`.
- Updated implementation state after Phase 2 verification with `npm run test`, `npm run build`, and `npm run test:e2e`.
- Updated parser loading so SheetJS is lazy-loaded only during Excel import, reducing the initial app bundle.
- Updated implementation state after Phase 3 verification with `npm run test`, `npm run build`, and `npm run test:e2e`.
- Updated ECharts chart/export code to lazy-loaded chunks and shared preview/export chart projection.
- Updated requirements, I/O, and test plan documents to match the implemented MVP.
- Updated implementation state after Phase 8 verification with `npm run test`, `npm run build`, `npm run test:e2e`, and `npm audit --omit=dev`.
- Updated chart preview so its viewport height remains fixed when the selection/settings panels expand.
- Updated default chart styling so lines are solid with no point markers unless the user enables a marker override.
- Updated default color assignment so adding or removing selected curves does not shift existing curve colors.
- Updated built-in style presets so scoped preset application uses the full dataset order and resets marker overrides to none.
- Updated P1/P2 scale handling so no arbitrary defaults are invented, but users can define valid bounds directly in the Scale panel.
- Updated the selection panel header mode label so it follows the active reagent/specimen grouping.
- Updated P1/P2 preset inputs and Export buttons with compact scoped sizing for better visual balance.
- Updated duplicate chart/CSV labels to include file name plus source column when duplicate labels occur across appended files.
- Updated style color controls to accept `#RRGGBB`, `RRGGBB`, `#RGB`, and `RGB` values.

### Fixed
- Fixed chart preview height stretching with expanded left/right panel content.
- Fixed default curve color shifting when earlier curves are selected later.
- Fixed static `시약별` selection-panel header text after switching to specimen view.

### Removed
- Nothing yet.

### Known Limitations
- Git repository is not initialized yet.
- GitHub Pages deployment is not configured yet.
- Clipboard image copy support has not been manually tested in Chrome/Edge on the final deployment origin.
- Static fixture files and expected normalized JSON snapshots do not exist yet; parser behavior is currently covered by generated workbook fixtures in Vitest.
- Performance budgets are not finalized.
- P1/P2 scale presets are editable in-session but not saved/reloaded across app sessions.
- pnpm installation is not usable on the current H: exFAT workspace because symlinks are unsupported; npm is verified.

### Planned
- Manual validation with the real `graph_TEST.xlsx` workbook.
- Clipboard verification in Chrome/Edge.
- GitHub repository setup and GitHub Pages deployment.
- Optional saved chart configuration or reusable preset persistence if the user prioritizes it.

### Deferred
- CSV import.
- Pasted or manual table input.
- In-app data editing.
- Multi-sheet picker.
- Layout/batch arrangement controls.
- SVG/PDF export.
- Transparent background export.

## [0.0.0] - 2026-07-07
