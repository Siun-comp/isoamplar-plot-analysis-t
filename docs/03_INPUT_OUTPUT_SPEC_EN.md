## Compression-Safe Summary
- MVP input is Excel upload only: `.xls` and `.xlsx`, first worksheet only. Additional Excel files may be appended to the current in-browser analysis.
- CSV, pasted table data, manual entry, and in-app data editing are deferred beyond MVP.
- Imported PCR data should normalize into stable specimen/reagent/curve records keyed by `curveId`; appended files must rekey curves to avoid ID collisions.
- Parsing should preserve original values and surface warnings.
- Output image and clipboard content should match the current rendered chart.
- PNG and JPEG export use white background and analysis-name-based filenames such as `YYMMDD_<sanitizedAnalysisName>_plotN.ext`.
- Plotted-data CSV, when enabled, uses the matching analysis-name-based filename stem such as `YYMMDD_<sanitizedAnalysisName>_plotN_data.csv` and includes only the current plotted chart projection.
- Chart styling uses stable default colors by original data/group order, solid no-marker lines by default, and optional individual marker overrides.
- Analysis XLSX is a web-app restore file containing the full imported dataset and settings; it is separate from plotted-data CSV and report-style chart workbooks.
- Internal analysis tabs keep separate in-browser analysis states; user data remains browser-local unless explicitly exported.

## Update Rule
Update this file when parsing rules, data types, invalid data handling, internal data shape, output formats, or error messages change.

## Supported Inputs

| ID | Input | Initial Rule | Related Requirements | Acceptance Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IO-001 | Excel workbook | Support `.xls` and `.xlsx` upload through browser file APIs; parse only the first worksheet. The user can replace the current dataset or append another file to the current analysis. | FR-001 | AC-001, AC-002, AC-PCR-001, AC-PCR-015, AC-PCR-016, AC-PCR-025 |
| IO-002 | CSV file | Deferred beyond MVP. | FR-002 | TBD |
| IO-003 | Pasted table | Deferred beyond MVP. | FR-003 | TBD |
| IO-004 | Manual entry / editing | Deferred beyond MVP. Imported data is not editable in MVP. | FR-003 | AC-PCR-017 |
| IO-005 | Analysis XLSX restore file | Support `.xlsx` files containing the hidden IsoAmplar restore sheet. `파일 선택` restores/replaces the active analysis when safe; `추가 선택` opens the saved analysis as a new internal tab. | FR-017, FR-018 | AC-PCR-033, AC-PCR-034, AC-PCR-036, AC-PCR-037 |

## Excel Rules
MVP target:

- File extension: `.xls`, `.xlsx`
- Source: browser file picker or drag and drop
- Processing location: browser
- Worksheet behavior: parse worksheet index 0 only.
- If worksheet index 0 is invalid, import fails even if later worksheets are valid.
- Later worksheets are ignored. The UI may show a notice that only the first worksheet was used.
- Row 1: specimen labels
- Row 2: reagent labels
- Row 3 onward: fluorescence values
- X axis: generated `Cycle 1~N` unless a later requirement explicitly adds source X values.

Parser policy:

- Empty trailing rows after the final row containing any fluorescence value are ignored.
- Internal empty fluorescence cells normalize to `null` and produce warnings.
- Empty data columns are ignored only when specimen header, reagent header, and all data cells are empty.
- Date, boolean, and error cells in fluorescence rows are treated as nonnumeric fluorescence unless later explicitly supported.
- Formula cells are never recalculated in the browser. Use cached finite numeric values when available; otherwise normalize to `null` and warn.
- Merged headers warn; do not silently infer repeated labels unless implementation later adds tested behavior.
- Negative numeric fluorescence values are valid raw values and should not warn by default.
- Maximum file size, maximum row count, and maximum column count remain performance-budget decisions.

## CSV Rules
CSV import is not part of the MVP. If added later, it must map into the same PCR curve model or require explicit specimen/reagent row confirmation.

## Analysis XLSX Rules
Analysis XLSX is a project/session restore file for IsoAmplar Plot Analysis. It is not a report workbook and does not contain a native editable Excel chart.

- Filename convention is `YYMMDD_<sanitizedAnalysisName>_analysisN.xlsx`, using browser-local date, the current analysis name, and the per-analysis export counter.
- If no usable analysis name is available, the safe name segment falls back to `analysis`.
- The analysis name segment must be sanitized so characters invalid on Windows/macOS/Linux filesystems are removed or replaced.
- Failed Analysis XLSX exports do not consume the analysis export counter.

Workbook shape:

- `README`: human-readable explanation that this file is for restoring an IsoAmplar analysis in the web app.
- `Settings`: human-readable analysis name, export date, app version, selected count, scale/style/legend summary, and source summary.
- `ImportedData`: full normalized imported dataset for review, including curves that are not currently selected or plotted.
- `Warnings`: import warnings preserved from the analysis.
- `_IsoAmplarAnalysis`: hidden worksheet containing `schemaVersion` and chunked JSON restore data. This hidden JSON is the authoritative restore source.
- `_IsoAmplarChecksum`: optional hidden worksheet for checksum or sanity markers; not emitted by the current implementation.

Restore payload must include:

- Full imported dataset with all curves, including unselected curves.
- Source metadata and source file summaries.
- Import warnings.
- Selected curve IDs, grouping mode, collapsed group IDs, search/filter state where applicable, and ordered curve IDs.
- Chart scale state, including Fixed and P1/P2 values.
- Style rules, including color/line/marker grouping rules, individual curve overrides with field-level custom/preset source metadata, legend/export settings, export layout, and export counter.
- Analysis name.

Restore payload must exclude transient UI state:

- Runtime internal-tab identity (`analysisId`) and dirty state; restore assigns a tab-local analysis ID and starts clean.
- Import/export progress state.
- Temporary export or clipboard messages.
- Hover/readout focus and tooltip state.
- One-step preset undo stack.

Routing policy:

- `파일 선택` + original Excel: replace active analysis when safe.
- `추가 선택` + original Excel: append to active analysis.
- `파일 선택` + Analysis XLSX: restore into active analysis when safe.
- `추가 선택` + Analysis XLSX: open as a new internal analysis tab.
- If dirty-tab close/replace UX is not finalized, any action that may lose unsaved analysis changes must be blocked with a clear message instead of silently replacing data.

If the hidden restore worksheet is missing, corrupt, chunk-damaged, or has an unsupported schema version, the app must show an actionable error and must not misinterpret the file as a normal PCR source workbook. Ordinary `.xlsx` source workbooks are treated as Analysis XLSX only when they contain the explicit IsoAmplar restore marker, so review-like sheet names such as `Settings` or `ImportedData` alone do not change routing. Restore may migrate older same-schema payloads by filling newly added non-destructive defaults such as group marker rules or legend/export settings.

## Report / Plotted XLSX Rules
Report/Plotted XLSX remains deferred and is separate from Analysis XLSX.

- Analysis XLSX is the only implemented workbook export for analysis continuation. It stores the full imported dataset and web-app settings so the user can reopen the file in IsoAmplar Plot Analysis and continue analysis.
- Report/Plotted XLSX would be a future reporting output for the current plotted subset, potentially with a static chart image and plotted data sheets.
- Report/Plotted XLSX must not be treated as a restore source unless it also contains the explicit hidden IsoAmplar restore payload.
- Native editable Excel chart generation is excluded from the current implementation and no chart-image workbook dependency is required.

## Pasted Table Rules
Pasted table input is not part of the MVP.

## Manual Entry Rules
Manual table entry and in-app data editing are not part of the MVP. Source data corrections should be made in Excel and reuploaded.

## PCR Header Interpretation
MVP rules:

- Row 1 is always specimen labels.
- Row 2 is always reagent labels.
- Row 3 onward is fluorescence data.
- Similar specimen or reagent names warn only; the app does not merge, rename, or correct labels. MVP similar-key rule trims labels, lowercases Latin text, removes whitespace/hyphen/underscore characters, and compares non-empty keys.
- Missing specimen or reagent labels produce warnings, preserve the empty raw label, and use source-position fallback display/identity. They do not by themselves invalidate the whole worksheet.

## Internal PCR Dataset Model
The normalized PCR dataset should be representable as:

```json
{
  "curves": [
    {
      "curveId": "sheet0_col_A",
      "specimenId": "specimen_1",
      "reagentId": "reagent_a1",
      "sourceId": "workbook:sheet0:colA",
      "specimenLabel": "Specimen 1",
      "reagentLabel": "A1",
      "x": [1, 2, 3],
      "y": [120, 130, 160],
      "warnings": []
    }
  ],
  "warnings": []
}
```

Curve IDs should be stable for a given workbook/sheet/column parse and should not depend on the current tree grouping. In a single parsed workbook, IDs use source position such as `sheet0_col_A`. When another workbook is appended into the current analysis, appended IDs are rekeyed with an import prefix such as `file2_sheet0_col_A` so selections, overrides, chart series, and export order do not collide with the existing dataset.

## Type Inference
Candidate data types:

- `text`
- `number`
- `date`
- `boolean`
- `empty`
- `mixed`

Type inference should not destroy original values. If parsing is ambiguous, the UI should show a warning. MVP does not provide manual correction; users correct the source workbook and reupload.

## Missing Value Handling
Candidate rule:

- Empty cells normalize to `null`.
- Empty fluorescence cells normalize to `null`.
- X values are generated cycle numbers in MVP and should not be missing.
- Chart-specific behavior for `null` fluorescence values must be implemented and tested.

Open questions:

- Missing Y values should create chart gaps and export as blank cells in plotted-data CSV.
- Should advanced filters treat empty strings and nulls as the same in a future version?

## Selection and Search Model
MVP selection is curve-based:

- `selectedCurveIds`: selected curves.
- `groupingMode`: `reagent` by default, `specimen` optional.
- `matchedCurveIds`: all curves matching current search across the full dataset.
- Search bulk actions apply to `matchedCurveIds`, including collapsed or nonvisible rows.
- Major groups start collapsed after import.
- No curves are selected by default after import.

## Chart Configuration Model
MVP chart configuration:

```json
{
  "chartType": "pcr-amplification-line",
  "x": {
    "source": "generated-cycle",
    "scale": {
      "mode": "fixed",
      "min": 1,
      "max": 45,
      "preset1": { "label": "P1", "min": "", "max": "" },
      "preset2": { "label": "P2", "min": "", "max": "" }
    }
  },
  "visibleCurveIds": ["sheet0_col_A"],
  "legend": {
    "visible": true,
    "mode": "grouped",
    "order": ["sheet0_col_A"],
    "exportLayout": "plot-plus-legend"
  },
  "legendSettings": {
    "previewVisible": true
  },
  "exportSettings": {
    "imageLayout": "plotWithLegend"
  },
  "styleRules": {
    "colorBy": "reagent",
    "lineTypeBy": "specimen",
    "markerBy": "reagent",
    "specimenColors": {},
    "reagentColors": {},
    "specimenLineTypes": {},
    "reagentLineTypes": {},
    "specimenMarkerTypes": {},
    "reagentMarkerTypes": {}
  },
  "curveOverrides": {
    "sheet0_col_A": {
      "lineType": "solid",
      "markerType": "none",
      "fieldSources": {
        "lineType": "preset",
        "markerType": "preset"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This structure may be refined during implementation but must preserve curveId-based identity.

## Outputs

| ID | Output | Initial Rule | Related Requirements | Acceptance Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IO-101 | Chart preview | Reflect current dataset, filters, mappings, layout, legend, and fixed scales. | FR-006 to FR-010 | AC-004 to AC-008 |
| IO-102 | Image download | Export the current chart preview as PNG or JPEG with white background. | FR-011 | AC-009, AC-PCR-010 |
| IO-103 | Clipboard image | Copy current chart image where supported, with fallback on failure. | FR-012 | AC-010 |
| IO-104 | Static build | Produce static assets that work on GitHub Pages. | FR-013 | AC-011 |
| IO-105 | Plotted data export | Export only currently plotted data when the current chart projection is simple and rectangular; otherwise disable with a clear reason. | FR-016 | AC-PCR-021, AC-PCR-022 |
| IO-106 | Analysis XLSX export | Export a full analysis restore workbook containing the complete imported dataset and settings. | FR-017 | AC-PCR-033, AC-PCR-034, AC-PCR-037 |

## Image Download Rules
- Formats: PNG, JPEG.
- Background: white only.
- Filename convention: `YYMMDD_<sanitizedAnalysisName>_plotN.ext`, using browser-local date and the current analysis name. Example: `260709_Run_A_plot1.png`.
- The analysis name segment is sanitized by trimming whitespace, replacing invalid filename characters and whitespace with `_`, collapsing repeated `_`, trimming surrounding `_`, and limiting the segment length. Blank or fully invalid names fall back to `analysis`.
- Export excludes UI controls and includes only the chart output.
- Export reflects current selected curves, scale, style, legend/order state, and selected export layout.
- Image export layouts:
  - `plotOnly`: exports only the chart canvas with the built-in ECharts legend hidden.
  - `plotWithLegend`: exports the chart plus a custom legend area below the plot so the legend does not obscure plotted data.
  - `legendOnly`: exports only the custom legend image for the current selected/order/style projection.
- PNG/JPEG download and clipboard PNG use the selected image export layout. Plotted CSV and Analysis XLSX are unaffected by image layout selection.
- Export uses the same chart option projection as preview. Preview layout height is fixed in the UI, while image export keeps its chart-only export dimensions.
- More than 20 visible curves warns but does not block export by default.
- Supported image export layouts:
  - `Plot only`: chart image only.
  - `Plot + Legend`: chart image plus custom legend outside the plot area.
  - `Legend only`: custom legend image only.
- The default image export layout includes the legend outside the plot area. The preview custom legend should not obscure plotted curves.

## Plotted Data Export Rules
- Format: CSV.
- Filename convention: `YYMMDD_<sanitizedAnalysisName>_plotN_data.csv`, using the same sanitized analysis name and `plotN` counter as image export.
- Counter rule: if data CSV is exported together with an image, both artifacts share the same `plotN`; if data CSV is exported alone, it receives the next browser-local `plotN`.
- Failed export attempts do not consume `plotN`.
- Data scope: current plotted curves only, in current legend/export order.
- Exclude hidden curves, unselected curves, and raw workbook data that is not part of the current chart projection.
- Enable only when the current chart state is simple: one chart, shared X values across visible curves, and rectangular CSV output possible.
- If not enabled, show a concise reason instead of exporting partial or misleading data.
- Header row starts with `Cycle`.
- Duplicate display labels are disambiguated by source file and column, for example `A1 / 검체 1 [sample.xlsx:A]`.
- `null` Y values export as blank CSV cells.
- CSV values are quoted when required by commas, quotes, or line breaks.

## Clipboard Rules
- Supported clipboard MIME type for MVP: `image/png`.
- Clipboard copy must be triggered by an explicit user action.
- Clipboard copy uses the same chart option projection as PNG export and a white background.
- If `navigator.clipboard.write` or `ClipboardItem` is unavailable, or if permission is denied, show a fallback message telling the user to download PNG instead.
- Clipboard copy does not consume the `plotN` filename counter unless a fallback download is explicitly performed.

## Implemented Export Counter Rules
- Browser session starts at `plot1` after a dataset import.
- Successful PNG/JPEG download increments `plotN`.
- Successful plotted-data CSV download increments `plotN`.
- Failed image, clipboard, or CSV attempts do not increment `plotN`.
- Changing the analysis name changes future filenames only; it does not reset the `plotN` or `analysisN` counter.
- Current MVP implements image and data CSV as separate actions; combined image+CSV export remains a future candidate.

## Future Output Candidates
These are not confirmed:

- Download chart configuration JSON.
- Export PDF.
- Export SVG.
- Save chart presets in localStorage.
- Report/Plotted XLSX containing current plotted data plus a static chart image.
- Native editable Excel chart generation is excluded unless a future decision explicitly reopens it.

## Error Messages
The application should provide clear messages for:

- Unsupported file type
- File too large
- Empty dataset
- Missing headers
- Duplicate headers
- Invalid chart mapping
- Fixed axis min greater than max
- Clipboard permission failure
- Export generation failure
- Missing or unsupported Analysis XLSX restore sheet
- Dirty active analysis replacement blocked because close/replace UX is not finalized
- Dirty analysis tab close blocked because close/replace UX is not finalized
